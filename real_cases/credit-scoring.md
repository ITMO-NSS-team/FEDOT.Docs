## Credit Scoring problem

## Credit Scoring Task
The purpose of credit scoring is to assess and possibly reduce the risk of a bank associated with lending clients. Risk minimization happens due to dividing potential borrowers into creditworthy and non-creditworthy borrowers. Division task = classification task.
Behavioural scoring involves an assessment of creditworthiness based on information about the borrower, characterizing his behaviour and habits and obtained from various sources.

For each of the borrowers, the probability of delay, related to the scoring score, is estimated. Then it is necessary to set a border separating "conscientious" and "unconscientious" borrowers.

## Approaches to solving scoring task
The credit scoring task can be solved using a single model. The figure shows an example of scoring model quality metrics (ROC AUC, KS) on single classifiers:

It is also possible to use an ensemble scoring model:

The ensembling make it possible to decrease the uncertainty in the model. 
However, the structure of such a model may be non-trivial.
Therefore, it is better to use the GPComp algorithm to create a chain.
Example of GPComp convergence for a simple chain of scoring models:

Example of GPComp convergence for a more complex (multi-level) chain of scoring models:

It can be seen that the GPComp algorithm converges more to a simpler tree, which is clear by the specifics of the problem to be solved (binary classification on a small number of features).
