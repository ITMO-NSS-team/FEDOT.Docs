# Real-world cases

We decided to prepare a set of real-world cases, that can be solved if effective way using FEDOT.

The [first case](/FEDOT.Docs/real_cases/credit-scoring) is the credit scoring problem (classification task). The task is to predict the default event for the bank customer according to the history of transactions.
The dataset is obtained from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit).  

The [second case](/FEDOT.Docs/real_cases/metocean-forecasting) is the metocean forecasting problem (multi-scale random process regression task).
The task is to create the N-step forecast for sea surface height time series using historical values of the process.
The dataset is obtained from numerical simulation of the Arctic ocean using the NEMO-LIM3 model setup (see the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1463500318301410) for details).

The other cases are under development now.
