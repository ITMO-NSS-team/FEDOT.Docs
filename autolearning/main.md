# Automated learning

The articles in this section described the different aspects of the automatic learning of the models. The specific case of the automatic learning is AutoML.

## What is AutoML?
AutoML is the concept of automating the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML solves problems of parameter optimization, feature selection, model type selection, etc.

## What is generative design of models?
Generative design solves the problems of growing new data-driven models, new composite models, ensembles or other compositions from already existing models, etc. These days, ideas of low-level "assembly" of the model for custom problem setting are implemented only in the context of NAS (Neural Architecture Search) direction and mainly for problems of pattern recognition. However, for all other classes of tasks and models (the application of which may be more effective than neural networks), these approaches are not implemented.

### The basic problems which can be solved by the generative design of the composite models are as follows:
* Lack of solutions for automation of the modeling process to solve custom problems (AutoML should be more omnivorous);
* The difficulty of applying new modeling techniques without re-implementing existing management solutions (ML should be simpler and more flexible to manage);
* Lack of established approaches to improving the reproducibility of the ML results (ML should be reproducible)
 
The goal of the Generative AutoML implementation is to improve the quality of analysis of various natural, technical and social processes by identifying composite models based on available data sets.
